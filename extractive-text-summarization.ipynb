It uses morphological analysis and dictionaries to identify the lemma of a word. Lemmatization produces valid words that can be found in a dictionary.\n\nFor example, lemmatizing the words \"running,\" \"runs,\" and \"ran\" would yield the lemma \"run\" for all three forms. Lemmatization takes into account the grammatical category of the word and ensures that the resulting lemma is a valid word in the language.\n\nLemmatization provides more accurate results than stemming, as it considers the word's context and preserves the semantic meaning of the word. However, it is computationally more expensive than stemming due to the need for dictionary lookups and morphological analysis.This technique is effective in achieving higher and better performance foer the natural language processing related tasks.But sometimes even have a negative effect if the context of the paragraph is

Don't let the name fool you: a black hole is anything but empty space. Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. In recent years, NASA instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are, to many, the most fascinating objects in space.The idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries. Most famously, black holes were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which showed that when a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core. If the core's mass is more than about three times the mass of the Sun, the equations showed, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.Scientists can't directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect x-rays, light, or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. We can, however, infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby. If a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter, for example, it will draw matter inward in a process known as accretion. A similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole. In this case, the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself. As the attracted matter accelerates and heats up, it emits x-rays that radiate into space. Recent discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them - emitting powerful gamma ray bursts, devouring nearby stars, and spurring the growth of new stars in some areas while stalling it in others.Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.) If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the \"event horizon,\" time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the surface reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a frozen collapsing object.Even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions. Soon after its launch in December 2004, NASA's Swift telescope observed the powerful, fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts. Chandra and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope later collected data from the event's \"afterglow,\" and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide, producing another black hole.\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-19T19:24:57.082170Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-19T19:24:57.082514Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-19T19:24:57.088251Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-19T19:24:57.082490Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-19T19:24:57.087117Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":66,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text__ = [\"\"\"Artificial Intelligence Essay: Artificial Intelligence is becoming the synonym for future.

The atmosphere is a gaseous layer containing nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. The hydrosphere is made up of all the water bodies, such as rivers and oceans.

The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere are the different layers that make up the environment. Several gases, like oxygen and nitrogen, that are required for life are found in the atmosphere. The hydrosphere is made up of all the water bodies, such as rivers and oceans. The environment is a term used to describe such circumstances.
